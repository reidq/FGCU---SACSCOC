                    <div class="section-description-div">
                        <h3>Polices and Procedures</h3>
                        <p class="block">Providing a computing and networking environment that ensures the security, integrity, and confidentiality of student records is the responsibility of Information Technology Services (ITS) in the Division of Administrative Services and Finance. In collaboration with the University's office of General Counsel, ITS has drafted specific policies regarding confidentiality and security protection, including FGCU's University Technology Resources Policy <a href="pdf/policy3.022.pdf">3.022</a> and FGCU Policy 3.042 <a href="pdf/Policy3042RestrictedData.pdf">Restricted Data</a>. FGCU's policies and procedures were developed in accordance with guidelines established by the American Association of Collegiate Registrars and Admissions Officers (AACRAO); the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (<a href="pdf/StudentRightsFERPAPolicieswebpage.pdf">FERPA</a>), as outlined by the U.S. Department of Education's Family Policy Compliance Office; and Florida statutes (<a href="pdf/FS1006.52Educationrecords.pdf">1006.52</a>, <a href="pdf/FS119.01PublicRecords.pdf">119.01</a>, <a href="pdf/FS1002.22EducationRecordsK12.pdf">1002.22</a>) guidelines, and general provisions concerning educational records and access to those records.</p>

                        <p class="block">Each unit (school, college, institute, center, or division) of the FGCU community that has access to student records is responsible for adhering to all related federal, state, and local laws, and FGCU rules, regulations, and policies. Because these laws and policies are subject to amendment and change, the units must ensure that their understanding remains current. The implementation and enforcement of FGCU's policies and procedures are coordinated by Academic Affairs, the Office of General Counsel, and the Division of Administrative Services and Finances, in collaboration with Records and Registration, the Information Technology Services (ITS) department, and other pertinent academic units.</p>

                        <p class="block">The institution maintains and keeps current an <a href="pdf/OfficeoftheGeneralCounselWebpage.pdf">online listing</a> of all University policies and regulations pertaining to privacy and security practices and processes. Access to student data is restricted to those with a legitimate educational interest. All access is removed from individuals prior to departure from FGCU employment (FGCU <a href="pdf/FGCUPolicy3.035LockandKey.pdf">Policy 3.035</a>). Additionally, several areas including Records and Registration and <a href="pdf/InformationTechnologyServices.pdf">Information Technology Services</a> are routinely audited for security procedures by both University and state auditors (Operations Audit,  November <a href="pdf/2023055.pdf">2022</a>).</p>

                        <p class="block">Students are informed through several channels about measures taken by the University to protect their records. These channels include the <a href="pdf/Academic_Catalog_Records_Registration.pdf">Academic Catalog</a>, the Records and Registration <a href="pdf/DepartmentofRecordsRegistrationwebpage.pdf">website</a>, and the Center for Academic Achievement <a href="pdf/CAAWebpageFERPA.pdf">website</a>. In addition, students and parents are educated at orientation as to their FERPA rights and responsibilities in addition to the FGCU web resources of these policies.</p>

                        <h3>Authorization and Security</h3>

Process that access confidential records and student information require <a href="pdf/TwoFActorauthenitication.pdf">two-factor authentication</a>, FGCU has partnered with Duo Security.</p>
