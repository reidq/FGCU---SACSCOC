                            integrity of student records. FGCU’s Educational Records Policy limits the release of
                            student information unless permitted by law, detailing practices for protecting directory
                            information and handling student data requests. The Department of Records & Registration
                            manages student records using the Ellucian Banner system and ensures secure storage of
                            physical records. Information Technology Services (ITS) ensures the security of computing
                            and networking environments, adhering to federal, state, and university policies. FGCU’s
                            security policies are developed in accordance with guidelines from AACRAO, FERPA, and
                            Florida statutes. Access to student data is restricted to those with legitimate educational
                            interests, and regular audits ensure compliance. The university employs extensive training
                            programs to educate employees on safeguarding student records, requiring specific
                            authorization for access and implementing two-factor authentication and other security
                            measures. Backup and disaster recovery plans are in place to maintain data integrity and
                            continuity.</p>
